# Soundboard base application
This application can serve as a basic framework for a soundboard. 

Copy your mp3 files into `app/src/main/res/raw` directory, 
add the config to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`, and run this; 
it will pick them up and display them in a list on the app.

strings.xml - <string name="filename_no_extension">Name on app screen</string>
